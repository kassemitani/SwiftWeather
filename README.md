## Installing Libraries and Dependencies using Pod Install 

- Open Terminal.

- If you haven't already done so, run this command:

- sudo gem install cocoapods
- Wait for it to finish before proceeding.

- Find the project directory in the Finder. This should be the folder that has the Xcode project in it.

- Type cd into the terminal, followed by a space.

- Drag and drop the project directory into the terminal window. It should now say something like this:

- cd /Users/someone/Downloads/SwiftWeather
- Press return.

- Now type pod install. Wait for that to finish. It could take a while
